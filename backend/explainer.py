"""
explainer.py - SHAP-based explainability for the TinyTots hybrid ASD model
=============================================================================
Uses shap.TreeExplainer on the Random Forest model (the dominant 60% member
of the ensemble, and the natural fit for SHAP's exact tree algorithm) to
compute per-feature contributions to the predicted ASD-risk probability.

Design notes:
  • TreeExplainer with a background sample gives SHAP values already in
    probability space (model_output="probability"), so a feature's SHAP
    value can be read directly as "+/- N percentage points of risk".
  • A small background sample (from the training data) is cached at
    startup so per-request explanation stays fast (<50ms).
  • Every raw feature (A1-A10 + demographics) is mapped to a clinically
    worded, direction-aware phrase so parents see plain language, not
    feature codes.
  • Falls back gracefully (returns None) if SHAP or the model isn't
    available, so /predict never breaks because of this module.
